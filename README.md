# Python Dominoes

Project for the Jetbrains Academy Python track. The basic
assignment was to build a simple CLI dominoes game. I challenged myself a 
bit by trying to keep methods short, and not receiving more than 4 parameters.
Additionally, I aimed to keep the cyclomatic complexity below 5.

# Usage

Run the game by running the `dominoes/dominoes.py` script.
